The Fall and the "Napoleon of Persia"
The century began with the Safavid Dynasty crumbling under an Afghan invasion in 1722. This vacuum was filled by Nader Shah, a brilliant military tactician who expelled the invaders and founded the Afsharid Dynasty. He turned Iran into a military powerhouse, famously sacking Delhi in 1739 and seizing the Peacock Throne. However, his relentless warring and late-life paranoia led to his assassination in 1747, plunging the country back into civil war.

The Zand Interlude
From the chaos emerged Karim Khan Zand, who ruled from Shiraz. Unlike the shahs before him, he refused the title of king, calling himself Vakil e-Ra'aya (Regent of the People). His reign is remembered as a rare "Golden Age" of 18th-century peace, focused on rebuilding the economy and the arts rather than conquest.

The Rise of the Qajars
Following Karim Khan’s death in 1779, the Qajar tribal leader Agha Mohammad Khan launched a brutal campaign to unify the country. By 1794, he had eliminated the last Zand heir and established the Qajar Dynasty. In 1796, he officially moved the capital to Tehran, setting the stage for the centralized, albeit pressured, Iranian state of the 19th century.
